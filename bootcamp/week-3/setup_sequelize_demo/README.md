//STEP 1: Create your db and export db, DATATYPES, Model classes

//STEP 2: Create your models and export them {nameOfModel}

//STEP 3: Create some data (.json file), refer to JSON format

//STEP 4: Create your seed file which contains your seed function that will utilize sequelize methods to help us insert our data into as rows in our table
        //import dependencies that will simplify finding the path to your data
        //import fs to help us read what file lives in the seedpath
        //import our database and models

        // create our seed function
            //clear our db
            //find our seed paths [x]
            //read data and parse information in seed files

            // Using the Sequelize method .create, we will insert the rows into our tables
            // resolve all the promises by using the .all method from the Promise class.
